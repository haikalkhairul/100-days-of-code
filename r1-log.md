## Log

### R1D1 
Did some easy questions on LeetCode to get started in this amazing journey :). In particular, 'Richest Customer Wealth' and 'Kids with the Greatest Number of Candies'. Questions were pretty easy, did the first one in Java and the second one in Python. Did not struggle on anything in particular.
